// ? TO DO: create a while loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100 // create a variable to represent the current number

// create a variable to represent the current total
let x = 1;
let total = 0;
// write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100

while (x <= 100) {
  total = total + x; // could also write as total += x
  x++;
}
console.log(total);
